<p>3 legislative wins ($355M)</p>
<ul>
<li>Corporate offshore sheltered income (GILTI) ($200M)</li>
<li>80/20 Rule ($80M)</li>
<li>Changes ED20 Rule - If an Illinois corporation kept 80% of their
profit off shore they didn’t have to pay tax. Now they have to pay a
tax.</li>
<li>Joyce to Finagan ($75M)</li>
</ul>
<p>Digital Ad tax ($150M) - Popular across chambers. - It was included
in the senate but removed before the final bill passed to the senate,
house moderates made clear that they will not vote for a budget that
include it. - Worry from legislators about being subject to litigation.
They point to Maryland. <em>CP note: Any new tax passed will be subject
to lawsuits at least in Chicago, it’s like a law of public
finance</em>.</p>
<p>Shift in overton window - taxing rich becoming more popular.</p>
<p>Thoughts on governor’s role <em>CP note: speak’s to CTU’s revenue
campaign</em> - Patrick Brosnon - Governor did not want Digital Ad tax -
Governor promoting austerity discipline to speak to anti-tax culture
(i.e. voters). -Hannah Gelder - ILRA didn’t target governor.</p>
<p>Political analysis</p>
<ul>
<li>ILRA worked well with the progressive caucus.</li>
<li>Need to expand to targeting mods.</li>
</ul>
